# Hello World!

I'm Tim, aka staubichsauger. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and I'm currently on track towards my Masters degree.

Linux (I use Arch by the way - and Debian), Go, and Containers are my main interests. I also play around with Arduino-based projects and music technology.
